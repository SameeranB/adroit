                                <p>Most of our Indian population prefers going to the restaurant themselves to enjoy their food experience. This in turn promotes long queues at the restaurants for hours. The need of the hour was to satisfy every foodie out there wandering for food without wasting their time; either standing outside the restaurant or having to fill his hunger by looking at food being served on other tables while still waiting for his own food to be served.</p>

                                        <p>Abbiocco is our first national product which aims at eradicating the time required to prepare food for the customers 
                                            as well as helps in saving the customer's time by not keeping him wait for his own food at the restaurant. <br><br>
                                            Our goal is to help every family to spend quality time outside their homes rather than opting for food-delivery at 
                                            their homes sitting in front of their TV sets. Our customers can choose from a wide range of restaurants from their
                                            cities based on cuisine types, recommendations or by directly selecting the food. Once the user orders what
                                             he wants, the user is given options to either dine-in or take-away their food from the restaurant. But when?
                                             This is where Abbiocco takes a whole new direction from the already running food delivery apps. 
                                             The customer chooses his time of arrival at the restaurant, while we; together with the restaurant, make sure 
                                             that your food is ready by the time the customer reaches the restaurant. You may ask, is the food fresh and
                                              hot by the time the customer comes? Well of course! <br><br>
