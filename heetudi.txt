ABBIOCCO:

THE PROBLEM - Most of our Indian population prefers going to the restaurant themselves to enjoy their food experience. This inturn promotes long ques at the restaurants for hours. The need of the hour was to satisfy every foodie out there wandering for food without wasting their time; either standing outside the restaurant or having to fill his hunger by looking at food being served on other tables while still waiting for his own food to be served.

OUR SOLUTION - Abbiocco is our first national product which aims at eradicating the time required to prepare food for the customers as well as helps in saving the customer's time by not keeping him wait for his own food at the restaurant. 

Our goal is to help every family to spend quality time outside their homes rather than opting for food-delivery at their homes sitting in front of their TV sets. Our customers can choose from a wide range of restaurants from their cities based on cuisine types, recommendations or by directly selecting the food. Once the user orders what he wants, the user is given options to either dine-in or take-away their food from the restaurant. But when ? This is where Abbiocco takes a whole new direction from the already running food delivery apps. The customer chooses his time of arrival at the restaurant, while we; together with the restaurant, make sure that your food is ready by the time the customer reaches the restaurant. You may ask, is the food fresh and hot by the time the customer comes? Well ofcourse! 
Doubt Us? Why don't you try it yourself !!!

HART:

THE PROBLEM - You might have seen the rush in most restaurants at peak hours right? The old pen-and-paper style of placing orders was not quiet working out well for the HART Lounge restaurant in Vellore city. The waiters would forget to add-on the food items of a table in the final bill due to the chaos of the rush hour. Well ofcourse it was a treat for the customers, but definately not for the restaurant owners...That's when we came into picture...

OUR SOLUTION - Our restaurant POS system aims at placing orders from individual table through the restaurant's personal mobile application which is inter-linked for the restaurant staff.
The app is interfaced in such a way that the waiters have absolutely no problems in taking orders. 
At the time of generating the invoice for a table, the cashier has to simply select the table number on the app and each order made from that table is displayed on screen. The waiter has to just:
-Select the table number.
-Select the quauntity of the food item from the displayed menu and click on ADD
-Click on continue and carry on taking orders from other tables.

Now that is a win-win for the restaurant owners. Sorry customers but no more free treats...
